      "The Trump administration slapped sanctions on three North Koreans Monday in response to Pyongyang's ongoing human rights abuses and censorship. The sanctions announcement comes as President Donald Trump floats the idea of a second summit with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un. And it immediately follows a failed US attempt to hold a UN meeting on Pyongyang's human rights record, a setback that illustrates the Trump administration's struggle to maintain international support for its maximum pressure campaign to push North Korea toward denuclearization. The Treasury Department marked Human Rights Day by sanctioning senior officials in previously targeted government entities of the North Korean regime and the Workers' Party of Korea, including the Ministry of State Security and the Ministry of Public Security. \"These sanctions demonstrate the United States' ongoing support for freedom of expression, and opposition to endemic censorship and human rights abuses,\" Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said in a statement. Otto Warmbier Treasury said the fresh sanctions highlight the \"reprehensible treatment of those in North Korea\" and serve as a reminder of the \"brutal treatment\" of Otto Warmbier, the US college student who died 18 months ago after detention in a North Korean jail. Warmbier would have turned 24 on December 12. \"It's a welcome re-acknowledgment of North Korea's awful record on human rights violations,\" said Bruce Klingner, a senior fellow at the Heritage Foundation. Joel Wit, director of the website 38 North and a senior fellow at the Stimson Center, dismissed the move. \"Sanctioning three officials is what I would call ankle biting,\" Wit said. \"It looks nice, but it's not going to have any affect at all ... it has to get on with the business at hand and that is reaching denuclearization deals with the North Koreans ... that's basically it.\" Trump is planning a second summit with Kim early in 2019, the President and some of his officials have said. National security adviser John Bolton has said the president wants to hold the second summit because the first, in Singapore in June, has yielded no progress. The sanctions announcement could be a signal on Human Rights Day; a reaction to criticism that Trump has seemingly dropped human rights from the North Korean agenda; a reaction to the US failure to stage a UN meeting; or an attempt to gain leverage for the next summit, Klingner said. \"We don't know whether it was meant as a signal in any of those areas or simply the bureaucracy doing its job,\" Klingner noted. The Trump administration has downplayed the importance of human rights generally and has been criticized for not giving it higher priority in its talks with North Korea. The President has declared he's in \"love\" with Kim, who has been deemed to have committed crimes against humanity, has had family members executed and ordered the assassination of his half-brother using chemical weapons. Despite the President's warm words, progress has been stymied. Most recently, satellite images showed North Korea is expanding a key long-range missile base, a reminder that diplomatic talks with the US have done little to prevent Kim from pursuing his promise to mass produce and deploy the existing types of nuclear warheads in his arsenal. Faltering Both Trump and Secretary of State Mike Pompeo are now emphasizing that they aren't putting a deadline on talks and that progress will take time. And both men have insisted that in the meantime, the US will continue to exert \"maximum pressure\" on North Korea through sanctions. But US officials, including US Ambassador to the United Nations Nikki Haley, have signaled that efforts to maintain unified international pressure on Pyongyang may be faltering. Haley has said the US pressure campaign is being undercut by smuggling and by countries such as Russia. Monday's sanctions come after the US had to postpone a Security Council meeting focused on North Korea's human rights record because it couldn't get enough countries to agree to hold the discussion, the Associated Press reported. The meeting, which has been held for several years now, failed to come together when the US couldn't get agreement from nine of the 15 council members to hold the meeting -- the minimum necessary to move forward. The week before, the North Korean ambassador to the UN had written all the council members except the US urging that the meeting be canceled and accusing the Trump administration of trying to \"stoke confrontation,\" the AP said. \"Despite what the administration might want to portray publicly, this whole approach of maximum pressure is basically dead and that's reflected in the fact the Russians and Chinese aren't going to play ball on that front anymore,\" Wit said.\n",

      "After a few weeks of quiet, the Cabinet reshuffle President Donald Trump teased in the days surrounding the midterm election has kicked into gear. On Friday, Trump announced nominations to fill his most high-profile vacancies. On Saturday he announced chief of staff John Kelly would leave by the end of the year. On Sunday, Nick Ayers, the top potential replacement for Kelly, said he wasn't interested in the job. Here's a look at where things stand with Trump's entire Cabinet, including who's under fire, who seems safe, and who is off the radar, first as a group and then by category: Under fire from Trump Trump told reporters on Saturday White House Chief of Staff John Kelly was on his way out of the White House. But the succession plan, which focused on elevating Vice President Mike Pence's chief of staff Nick Ayers has fallen apart, creating a vacuum. Several other top Trump officials -- OMB Director Mick Mulvaney and Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin are in the mix, but no one appears to be jumping to be the third person to be Trump's top aide. Trump's announcement follows months of speculation over how long Kelly would last in the job, and numerous reports of tension between the two men. Kelly's departure could also spell trouble for Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen, who is linked to Kelly. In an interview with Fox News after the election, Trump didn't sound very high on either Nielsen or Kelly. \"I want her to get much tougher, and we'll see what happens there,\" he said of his DHS chief. And of Kelly: \"There are a couple of things where it's just not his strength. It's not his fault, it's not his strength.\" The replacements On Friday, Trump told reporters he would nominate William \"Bill\" Barr, a former attorney general during the George H.W. Bush administration to replace former Attorney General Jeff Sessions on a permanent basis. The news came just days after Trump attended the former President's funeral at the National Cathedral in Washington. Barr has previously defended Trump's decision to fire FBI Director James Comey and been critical of the Russia probe, but his strong reputation in Washington suggests he could have an easy confirmation. Trump also said he would replace outgoing US Ambassador to the UN Nikki Haley, one of the most popular women in his Cabinet, with State Department spokeswoman (and former Fox News host) Heather Nauert. The catch is that the position will be downgraded and removed from Trump's Cabinet. Nauert's lack of traditional experience could lead to a tough confirmation. Under fire from outside There's a big difference between drawing public scrutiny and drawing scrutiny from Trump. He's shown a willingness to stick with someone amid public scandals if he's otherwise happy with the job they're doing. That's how Scott Pruitt, the former EPA administrator, hung on for months despite a growing list of investigations into possible abuse of his power. But former HHS Secretary Tom Price was gone relatively quickly over his use of private planes, which happened to coincide with Republicans' failure to repeal the Affordable Care Act. Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke is the subject of a DOJ investigation, while Labor Secretary Alexander Acosta is under scrutiny for his previous role in a plea deal for multimillionaire pedophile Jeffrey Epstein. Education Secretary Betsy Devos and Housing and Urban Development Secretary Ben Carson have also faced public scrutiny, though that's died down recently. Filling a vacancy One thing that could complicate a shakeup is that Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell has made it clear that no Republican senators can be spared for Cabinet roles. When Jeff Sessions became Trump's attorney general, Republicans subsequently lost Sessions' old seat in the reliably red state of Alabama. There are two acting secretaries in Trump's Cabinet. Andrew Wheeler has carried on in Pruitt's mold on the policy front at the EPA. While Trump has announced his intent to name Wheeler to the job permanently, he hasn't yet filed the necessary paperwork. The situation for acting Attorney General Matthew Whitaker is more tenuous. The White House broke protocol to put him in the role, bypassing Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein. It's unclear how extensively Whitaker was vetted, considering the amount of heat he has drawn over his ties to a patenting company shut down by the government this year over allegations of fraud. His days in the administration are numbered now that Trump has said he'll nominate Barr to the position. In the game There remains a core group of cabinet officials and top advisers whose jobs appear to be safe. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo is among those closest to Trump, taking the lead on negotiations with North Korea and the response to the Jamal Khashoggi murder. National security adviser John Bolton, the third man to hold the job under Trump, has consolidated power since coming on board in March and has dictated much of the administration's hardline foreign policy. Bolton reports directly to the President. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer is negotiating with China and enforcing Trump's tariffs while OMB Director Mick Mulvaney has been tasked with additional jobs like overseeing the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. And then there's Vice President Mike Pence, who has taken on a wide portfolio, including standing in for Trump on the campaign trail, while also projecting stalwart loyalty. It's complicated There's nothing to indicate that people like Defense Secretary James Mattis or Director of National Intelligence Dan Coats are on their way out. But both men have not been afraid to make their differences with Trump known at times, Coats on the issue of Russian meddling and Mattis on issues like US troops at the border with Mexico. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin is also not often discussed as a trouble spot for the President, but he hasn't exactly been the most forceful Cabinet secretary. Plus, he is the lone remaining Goldman Sachs alum (now that Gary Cohn is out) with free trade tendencies visible on the President's economic team. Mnuchin recommended Jay Powell to lead the Fed and Trump has said he now regrets the decision, given Powell's interest rate hikes. Gina Haspel is the first woman to lead the CIA and Trump has not publicly split with her, but the CIA has clearly split with Trump on Khashoggi and her briefing for senators has helped fuel their momentum to penalize Saudi Arabia for the murder despite Trump's wishes. Under Trump's radar You don't hear quite as much about these Cabinet secretaries, either because their agencies are not at the top of national headlines or because they aren't pushing their way to the front. Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar has pleased Trump with the new drug pricing plan. Agriculture Secretary Sonny Perdue helped placate aggravated farmers after tariffs and is overseeing billions in payments to help offset their difficulties. While Carson was the subject of an early scandal over expensive furniture purchased for his office, the issue blew over and news around Carson is scarce these days. Energy Secretary Rick Perry has been busy promoting nuclear power abroad, including in Saudi Arabia, and propping up the US coal industry. Transportation Secretary Elaine Chao is among the quietest of Trump's Cabinet secretaries. Mitch McConnell's influential wife is the keeper of the infrastructure plan Trump has long promised. DeVos suffered some initial stumbles, but has remained out of the broader conversation, though she's come under fire from activists recently, particularly over her efforts to reform Title IX. Small Business Administrator Linda McMahon is quietly running the SBA but may have higher aspirations, while Veterans Affairs Secretary Robert Wilkie has helped stabilize an agency in turmoil after the firing of former Sec. David Shulkin.\n",
      "She had pictured the trick plenty of times in her mind's eye and even tried it once onto an airbag but no woman had ever pulled it off on snow. Now, high on Austria's Stubai Glacier, snowboarder Anna Gasser gazed down at the huge white ramp that could propel her into history. Quiet in her helmet and dark goggles, Gasser contemplated her leap into the unknown. \"I'm thinking triple,\" she whispered. Specifically, she was thinking a cab triple 1260, a trick that involves taking off in the switch position -- the opposite direction of travel with your \"wrong\" foot forward -- before completing three-and-a-half full rotations and landing with your other foot in front. Pulling it off would require confidence, commitment, and a whole lot of bottle. \"For sure it was one of the craziest tricks I've ever done,\" the 27-year-old Austrian told CNN Sport. Staring down the run in, Gasser tried to flood her body with confidence. Naturally, though, nerves crept in. Her stomach churned, but she hopped forward on her snowboard and started speeding towards the giant snow ramp sculpted by machines. READ: 'Spiritual' end to 157-day swim around Great Britain \"I had some butterflies in my stomach for sure before I dropped in,\" said Gasser, who won gold in the big air contest at the PyeongChang Winter Olympics in 2018. \"There was not much going through my mind actually, I was just trying to trust myself and telling myself that I could do it. Other than that, I was just full-on focusing on what I wanted to do.\" Gasser knew a big take off would be essential. A triple requires far more force and power than your average jump; complete commitment to the cause is key, because abandoning the trick midair can be treacherous. She sped up the steep ramp and launched into the Austrian sky. Once airborne, the feeling was like nothing she had experienced on a snowboard before. Gasser had made history before when she became the first female snowboarder to perform a cab double cork 900 -- two back somersaults and a horizontal spin, giving the effect of a corkscrew -- in November 2013. Now she was about to take the sport into another new realm. Visit CNN.com/TheMoment for more stories and videos \"I had more physical power than I've experienced compared to another trick ... There's so much more physics to jump up and spin that fast,\" says Gasser. \"As soon as I took off I knew there was no way back because when you initiate it you cannot open up anymore. It's maybe more dangerous than just going for it.\" It was a trick so daring, so nerve-wracking, and so exhilarating, that it took Gasser an hour away from the slopes to come to terms with what she had just done and for the rush to subside. \"My heart was still racing and I had so much adrenaline,\" she says. \"I went to sit down for an hour before I started riding again.\" Her secret? It was all about waiting for the right moment and seizing it with both hands when it came. \"I've had the trick on my mind for a long time, over a yea now,\" she admits. \"I've been doing doubles for so long and I knew the next step would be to go for the triple. I just knew I had to feel it and that was the case when I was at Stubai.\" Gasser's milestone was, in many ways, a giant leap for women's snowboarding, five years after her double. To put that in perspective, Torstein Horgmo became the first man to land a triple cork in 2010, seven years after JP Walker stomped the first recorded double. READ: How to ski fast -- the US special forces way 'It's about freedom' Gasser has arrived at her snowboarding career via an early life competing in gymnastics. Despite being selected for the Austrian national squad at the age of 14, she wasn't satisfied her athletic energies being spent on the bars. \"I was a competitive kid and I just thought that I wasn't good enough at gymnastics at that age,\" she explains. \"It was really time consuming. I had a lot of fun and it was a passion of mine but at one point I was like, it's not worth the work for what I get out of it. \"Then I stopped with the gymnastics side and after not doing anything for two years my cousin took me snowboarding for the first time and I just loved. \"It's more about freedom. You always decide yourself what you're going to do with snowboarding. In gymnastics someone tells you what to do; with snowboarding actually in the first couple of years it was everything I wanted to do. I loved it from the beginning.\" It's a love that, in recent years, has brought great success. Slopestyle gold at the Winter X Games in 2017 was backed up with big air gold at the world championships in Sierra Nevada a few months later. At the start of 2018 she won gold at the Winter X Games, and she added victory in the inaugural Olympic big air competition in South Korea. READ: World's best ski resorts in 2018 With the confidence of the world's first cab triple 1260 in her locker, Gasser is flying high. But she's keen to keep pushing the sport -- and herself. \"In snowboarding there are always a lot of ways to improve,\" she says. \"It doesn't always have to be a triple. \"There so much more stuff I can learn and want to learn. \"Of course I want to be one of the top girls but I'm just going to see how it feels. In this sport you never know what's going to happen.\"\n",
      "Located in the industrial city of Chiba, just outside of Tokyo, CEATEC is the biggest electronics show in Japan. Each year, the nation which gave the world the bullet train, the Walkman and blue LED light showcases its latest, cutting-edge consumer technologies. In 2017, Sharp introduced the 8K era with its dazzling 27-inch monitor of the same resolution due to release next month, Lenovo debuted a Star Wars Jedi Challenge game that allowed users to engage in virtual reality lightsaber battles and there were robots galore. This is, after all, Japan. CNN highlights eight of the quirkiest inventions showcased at the event. Get the perfect chew It looks like a Bluetooth hands-free device, but bitescan is actually measuring your chewing strokes as you eat. Hung from the ear, it is smaller and lighter than existing bite counters (they're normally attached to the chin) and can determine a user's bite speed, number of bites per minute and type of bite using a waveform detected on the back of the ear. Sharp has somewhat gamified the concept: the device syncs up to a smartphone app which categorizes results by animal type i.e. slow chewers are tortoises. The product will go on sale next year. Sharp says it will then share the data it collects with Japanese universities. The aim, it says, is to allow the user to achieve the perfect chewing habits. Quite why we need to do this will presumably become clearer in time. Earprint to replace the fingerprint? Thought your fingerprint was secure? Think again. Researchers at Michigan State University last year proved it can be hacked using little more than an inkjet printer. Enter the earprint. Developed by US-based technology firm Descartes Biometrics, it works like this: Firstly, the user downloads the ERGO software onto their smartphone. The user lifts the device to the side of their head and presses the center of the touch screen on their ear. A sound is then sent into the ear, and due to the \"unique geometry of the ear,\" the sound that is echoed back is specific to each individual. ERGO uses sensors embedded in modern Android smartphones, meaning no additional hardware is required. Authentication takes about one second, and the company says, improves with use, storing up to ten scans of the user's ear. An army of factory robots Omron artificial intelligence (AI) Automatic Transportation Mobile Robot machines are designed to work together in factories. The white robots, launched in January, gather data as they roam around, creating maps in their \"brain\" which they then use to independently navigate their environment. All the controller has to do is set the robot's destination and it will navigate its own route. Laser sensors on all sides of the \"body\" allow the robot to detect unexpected objects -- a person, for example. Using those maps, it can reroute to the destination. The robots can travel at 1.8 meters per second, and carry a maximum load of 130 kg -- although the greater the load the slower they travel. And their application isn't limited to factories. At Incheon Airport in South Korea, a mobile robot has been serving customers drinks. The calorie scanner Dinner is ready. But don't tuck in. First you need to put it through your calorie scanner. That's the idea behind CaloRieco. Its infrared scanner measures nutrients within an accuracy range of 20%, according to manufacturer Panasonic. Current calorie scanners take between two and three minutes, the tech here works in just 10 seconds. As well as people hoping to lose weight, the product is also aimed at those with diabetes and other diet-affected health conditions. The scanner stores nutritional data, and Panasonic hopes that eventually it will be able to suggest recipes according to users' needs. The price and launch date are both to be decided. Supermarkets of tomorrow Online stores are nothing new, but what if physical shops went online, too? That's the idea behind Usockets, a series of electronic supermarket price tags which feed into a centralized system that uses real-time data to manage a store. Not enough footfall in the dairy aisle? The system's heatmap can identify that and automatically lower prices on items that need to sell. It gets even smarter. A technology called LinkRay allows shoppers to scan price tags with their smartphones to activate videos, providing more extra product information. The technology is still under development, but gives an insight into what the shops of the future could look like. A digital makeover Ever wondered what you'd look like with thicker eyebrows? Or wearing fake eyelashes? Panasonic's Makeup Design Tool lets users experiment with these possibilities and more. The graphics editing software in video simulation mode uses a live video as its canvas. Users can apply makeup on their image, getting a realistic projection of their virtual makeover. Brushes of different sizes can be selected to draw hairs on the face, or apply blusher. The technology is targeted at makeup stores, wedding photography studios and cosmetic brands. The application is finished, and Panasonic says it is looking for business partners, such as make-up brands, to take it to market. The perfect babysitter? \"Good morning, did you have a good sleep?\" asks the Cocotto. Billed as the perfect childcare partner by Panasonic, the bowling ball-shaped android can tell sleepy children to go to bed, download songs from the cloud to sing to little ones, and help a child's educational development. Parents instruct the spherical social robot, making it their helper as much as the child's friend. Oh, and it has some seriously cute facial expressions. Qoobo Therapy Robot A headless robotic cat might not sound that therapeutic, but believe us it is. The Qoobo has been developed by Japanese firm Yukai Engineering and funded by a KickStarter campaign. When a user pets the cushion-shaped and sized toy, its tail wags. The more vigorous the patting, the harder the wagging. The Qoobo will launch next June and retail for $100, with an eight-hour battery life. \"It's a comforting communication that warms your heart the way animals do,\" say the manufacturers. \"Wrap yourself with fuzzy love.\"\n",
      "CNN's National Security analyst Samantha Vinograd discusses Jared Kushner, Jamal Khashoggi, and the expansion of a missile base in North Korea.\n",
      "Every week, I offer a glimpse of the kind of intelligence assessments that are likely to come across the desk of the President of the United States, modeled on the President's Daily Briefing, or PDB, which the director of national intelligence prepares for the President almost daily. Here's this week's briefing: The US is focused on reaching a short-term trade deal with Beijing. But China is focused on playing the long game in ways that threaten US national security. US negotiators are preparing for talks during their 90-day trade truce with China, and this isn't a simple game of Chinese checkers. While alleviating the economic pressures of the trade war at home is a priority, China's President Xi Jinping also wants to extend its reach elsewhere. We appear narrowly focused on selling more soybeans and reducing our trade deficit, but China is not as myopic. It is just as focused on other priorities, many of which impact our own national security. That's why any moves we make against China -- including the arrest of Huawei's CFO Meng Wanzhou -- could be met in a variety of threatening ways. Here are several activities that China is already engaged in to advance its strategic interests: The best in the business: We've said publicly that China is one of our biggest cyber threats. And since China views cyber operations as a low-cost tool to achieve strategic objectives, it will keep improving its cyber capabilities. While we plan to address cyber theft as part of our trade negotiations (with possible charges against Chinese nationals for hacking), Chinese hackers have penetrated a lot of our public and private places. We have not publicly verified reports that it was behind the massive Marriott data breach. But China has penetrated classified security clearance information before -- in addition to state-sponsored cyber espionage against the private sector for commercial advantage. They've had time to refine their skills since agreeing to stop this in 2015. Increased Chinese economic uncertainty and any anger directed at us for trade war intransigence could lead to increased efforts to ramp up cyber espionage that would jeopardize sensitive information and expose China's skills, and our own insecurities, in cyberspace. Cementing the new North Korean normal: You are preparing for a second summit with Kim Jong Un while China seeks to continue Kim's steady march toward normalcy on the world stage. Now that the Chinese have less reason to fear a US military strike against North Korea, they are less concerned with placating the White House and can double down on making North Korea great again. Xi probably figures that the more integrated Kim is with the world, the less likely the US is to revert to fire and fury rhetoric. Plus, if Kim behaves better, you could eventually lift some sanctions which would benefit China. China is North Korea's largest trading partner and wants sanctions lifted so it can resume exporting at pre-sanctions levels. Xi's also reportedly thinking about a trip to North Korea soon. With or without a visit, Xi's aware of your perception that he has some control over Kim and could try to exploit any of his leverage over Kim -- including trying to pull Kim further away from your stated goal of denuclearization -- if trade talks falter. Relationship advice: Relationships with China are complicated, and if you get into a fight, China has a lot of tools to make your life uncomfortable. Take Taiwan as an example. The island nation has been at odds with China for decades and suffered the economic, security and diplomatic consequences. Because Taiwan's recent election resulted in a victory for the pro-Chinese Kuomintang Party, it's likely that China will step up its efforts to bolster pro-China sentiment in Taiwan while trying to peel away more of its allies, business contacts and global support system. The Chinese also know Taiwan's security is a core focus for the US. Any increased Chinese pressure on Taiwan could be a double win for Xi because it serves China's interest in controlling Taiwan while concurrently hurting our focus on opposing further Chinese gains, especially while they try to extend their sphere of influence elsewhere in the region. Buying new friends: While we criticize \"questionably run\" Third World countries, China is devoting a lot of time and money-making inroads around the world. Xi has visited Africa four times and just hosted another economic cooperation summit where he emphasized the shared future of Africa and China and announced $60 billion in investments in Africa. While China continues investing in Africa and around the world (Xi's multibillion-dollar One Belt, One Road initiative covers more than 60 countries) expect Xi also to continue his debt diplomacy efforts so more countries are tied to, and reliant on, China going forward. But US policymakers can act to protect national security interests. They can do so by making clear to Chinese counterparts that regardless of what happens on trade, we're going full steam ahead when it comes to countering Chinese aggression on every other front. This could include indicting Chinese hackers to declaring our ongoing commitment to defending Taiwan. We're also assessing evolving developments on the following issues: Dancing to the White House shuffle: The high pace of administration staff changes may be viewed as exploitable opportunities for our enemies. As part of their mission to undermine our credibility, you should expect them to use information warfare to exploit perceptions of US disorganization during these transitions. Yellow Vests and friends: Russia likes to stoke protests and create discord. They've supported divisive groups on all sides of controversial issues in the US. And there are indications that Russia got involved in the Yellow Vest protests in France, at least via social media, where we've seen Russian accounts spread inflammatory content. If protests continue, we should expect Russia to keep amplifying them as part of their overall mission of sowing divisions and undermining the democratic order. Keep talking about Yemen: While Congress continues its scrutiny of Saudi support for the war in Yemen, the \"positive spirit\" at ongoing peace talks could be a sign of progress toward at least mitigating some of the violence and ongoing humanitarian disaster. We assess that ongoing congressional scrutiny of Saudi Arabia could, in fact, lead the Kingdom to make some concessions in the talks because of a desire to try to improve its public image, even slightly. The chicken or the egg: Iranian President Hassan Rouhani said last week that if sanctions continue, Iran's abilities \"in fighting drugs and terrorism in their origins is undermined\" and \"you will not be able to survive the debris of drugs, refugees and bombs and assassination.\" Rouhani has it backwards -- sanctions don't beget terrorism. Rather, Iran is currently the largest state sponsor of terror in the world and is sanctioned because of its support for terrorism, among other things. Still, Rouhani just blamed sanctions for the country's inability to control future attacks on the West. His fear-mongering statements are propaganda (he won't ever miss a chance to blame others for his own shortcomings) but also a clear threat. You should expect the Iranians to ramp up their warnings about the consequences of more sanctions as the sanctions start to really bite. We will also monitor whether there are increased threats -- terrorist and otherwise -- as Iran tries to push back on the US.\n",
      "This week on \"Inside Politics,\" our panel of top political reporters shared their near-term political predictions. 1. Pelosi winning over more House freshmen At least 10 incoming House Democrats won their races after promising to oppose Nancy Pelosi as House speaker. But CNN's Manu Raju reports several are already bowing to pressure. \"A number of them are starting to go quiet as we get close to the speaker's vote, and some are actually suggesting they're going to support her in January,\" Raju said. Pelosi can only afford to lose around 18 votes on the floor, and some of these new members know they have leverage. \"They're holding out for something that Pelosi could give them, potentially committee assignments that typically are given to more senior members,\" Raju said. \"So some of these members may get something, and may ultimately vote for her. But of course, they said something different on the campaign trail, so they'll have to answer to that back home.\" 2. Outlook dims for criminal justice reform bill Meanwhile over in the Senate, the outlook for a criminal justice reform bill looks dim, despite support from President Donald Trump and a large bipartisan group of lawmakers. With just days to go in the lame duck session, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell has all but ruled out a vote, The Washington Post's Seung Min Kim said. \"He has told donors, outside groups, and his own advisers that chances of a vote are pretty unlikely,\" Kim said. \"That's despite this very unusual left-right coalition that supports this legislation,\" which would allow thousands of federal inmates to get out early and reduce drug-related mandatory minimum sentences. \"But it's still a bill that is extremely divisive within the Senate Republican conference. There's been some heated discussions about this legislation, and if there's one thing that Mitch McConnell does not like, it's legislation or initiatives that really split his conference.\" 3. Another North Korea summit? Get ready for a sequel to the historic summit between the United States and North Korea. \"John Bolton predicted it'll happen perhaps early next year,\" Politico's Eliana Johnson said. And Bolton's reasoning? It's not because North Korea has followed through on the promises they've already made, but because they haven't. \"He said North Korea has not honored their commitments that they made at the first summit last June, and so the President thinks we need a second summit, which is not the way it usually works,\" Johnson said. 4. Trump turns to 2020 White House chief of staff John Kelly is not the only major administration departure. The political director, Bill Stepien, is leaving to join Trump's re-election campaign. Taken together, the moves show an administration that's turning from governing to campaigning, CNN's Jeff Zeleny reports. \"With all the drama in Washington, the White House is actually looking ahead to 2020,\" Zeleny said. \"It's just around the corner in their view.\" \"I'm told the President has told his advisers he wants more campaign rallies and he wants them soon, starting early in the year,\" Zeleny said. \"The Trump team wants to go back to what makes him happy and have him surrounded by adoring fans at rallies.\" 5. GOP's darkening mood And from CNN Chief National Correspondent John King: The near silence from leading Republicans about the latest court filings by the special counsel and federal prosecutors in New York masks a dark GOP mood about the road ahead. Most colorful of a series of exchanges with veteran GOP lawmakers and operatives in recent days was this on the question of what to expect: \"Vicious, bilious gridlock with a sprinkling of constitutional crisis. Should be fun.\" That snark, or sarcasm, is pretty common among Republicans, who were in a glum place even before the court filings accusing the President of violating campaign finance laws and detailing new allegations against members of his inner circle. In the President's angry tweetstorms, they see proof he will not change behavior they view as central to why they just endured a midterm shellacking that cost the GOP its House majority. And now, with the Mueller probe intensifying and Democrats about to get subpoena power in the House, Republicans predict a bunker mentality White House where the President puts his survival -- and his re-election -- ahead of any concerns about the broader Republican Party. Another of the GOP sources said the conversations about the recent court filings only add to the President's belief the investigations are increasingly targeting his family. \"This is getting to Jr. and Javanka,\" is how one GOP operative in frequent touch with the White House put it, using shorthand for Donald Trump Jr. and Jared Kushner and Ivanka Trump. Adding to the GOP angst about the stretch ahead is the search for a new chief of staff. There was considerable frustration with John Kelly, but he was largely responsive to GOP leaders and was viewed as someone at least trying to impose some order and discipline at the White House. The leading candidate to replace Kelly is Nick Ayers, currently the chief of staff for Vice President Mike Pence. Ayers is well known in GOP circles because of his work at the Republican Governors Association and on past campaigns. But his experience is in politics -- not policy or government -- and most Republicans outside of the White House believe an Ayers hiring would prove their point the President is making his 2020 re-election the priority. As to the virtual silence among GOP leaders about the substance of the damning court filings, one of the GOP strategists contacted over the weekend said \"the fear factor is No. 1\" -- meaning even GOP lawmakers who are profoundly disappointed by the President's conduct remain skittish about saying anything that would bring a presidential counterpunch.\n"

      "The arrest of a top Huawei executive raises the stakes in the intensifying battle between the United States and China for tech supremacy. Huawei is one of the world's biggest makers of smartphones and networking equipment. It is at the heart of China's ambitions to reduce its reliance on foreign technology and become an innovation powerhouse in its own right. The country is pumping hundreds of billions into its \"Made in China 2025\" plan, which aims to make China a global leader in industries such as robotics, electric cars and computer chips. The introduction of 5G wireless technology, which hinges on Huawei, is a top priority. The United States, meanwhile, has made clear it intends to push back against China's growing tech power in order to maintain American dominance. \"In the 20th century, steel, coal, automobiles, aircraft and ships — and the ability to produce things in mass quantity — were the sources of national power,\" said James Andrew Lewis, director of the Technology Policy Program at the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington, in a report this week. \"The foundations of security and power are different today. The ability to create and use new technologies is the source of economic strength and military security.\" It's through that lens that some in the Chinese government view the arrest of Huawei's chief financial officer, Meng Wanzhou. Meng was detained on December 1 in Canada, at the request of US authorities seeking her extradition. \"The US is trying to do whatever it can to contain Huawei's expansion in the world simply because the company is the point man for China's competitive technology companies,\" said an editorial Thursday in state-run newspaper China Daily. Weng's case could rapidly escalate a broader fight that's been steadily building. Much depends on the language the United States uses moving forward — and how China ultimately responds. On Saturday, China said Meng's arrest \"severely violated the Chinese citizen's legal and legitimate rights and interests, it is lawless, reasonless and ruthless, and it is extremely vicious.\" Growing pressure China's tech aspirations have garnered concern in the United States for years — especially because Beijing's goals are seen as relying on the misappropriation of American technology. President Donald Trump has tried to tackle these issues directly. His administration says that the hundreds of billions of dollars in tariffs it's slapped on Chinese goods are part of an effort to stop China from stealing US tech. Officials also say that China must stop forcing companies to hand over trade secrets as a condition of market access. Meanwhile, the United States has targeted Chinese tech companies that rely on US parts. The Commerce Department in April banned American companies from exporting essential components to ZTE, which the agency said had violated an earlier deal punishing the company for evading sanctions on Iran and North Korea. The high-profile move forced ZTE to halt almost all of its operations for months. In October, the department issued a similar export ban for state-owned Chinese chipmaker Fujian Jinhua. The US government said it posed \"a significant risk of becoming involved in activities that are contrary to the national security interests of the United States.\" At the same time, Chinese President Xi Jinping has been pushing for China's tech sector to become more self-sufficient by cutting reliance on foreign suppliers. Turning the spotlight on Huawei, however, adds a new wrinkle. Huawei is a state champion that plays a crucial role in China's rollout of 5G. The company has spent heavily on research and development and on marketing its 5G devices. Paul Triolo, the head of global tech policy at risk consultancy Eurasia Group, said it's the only company in the world right now that can produce all the elements of a 5G network, such as base stations, data centers, antennas and handsets, and put them together \"at scale and cost.\" \"Xi Jinping says that he wants China to dominate the 5G market globally,\" Lewis told CNN Business. \"A lot of people see it as the next wave of technology [and think] it will be like the internet or smartphones.\" The Huawei risk But for Huawei to succeed at building out 5G networks, it needs the United States. Out of the Huawei's 92 main suppliers, 33 are US companies, including chipmakers Intel, Qualcomm, and Micron, and software firms Microsoft and Oracle, Tom Holland of Gavekal Research said in a note Friday. \"If Washington now prohibits these companies from selling to Huawei, the Chinese telecoms giant will struggle to survive,\" Holland said. The Meng case, then, has major ramifications. The US government claims that Meng covered up violations of sanctions on Iran, according to Canadian prosecutors, who spoke at Meng's bail hearing in Vancouver on Friday. Whether Huawei itself faces legal trouble remains to be seen, though there's speculation that the company could receive an export ban due to sanctions violations like the one imposed on ZTE. Such a ban, if enacted, would be catastrophic for the company — and would derail Beijing's plans to deploy 5G on a large commercial scale by 2020. \"The arrest of Huawei's CFO in Canada will significantly raise the uncertainty of China's 5G timing, since any US export ban imposed on Huawei could either delay China's 5G rollout, or significantly reduce the scale near term,\" Jefferies analyst Edison Lee said in a note Friday. Such a ban would force Huawei's business to \"come to a halt,\" he added. In this, the United States has the upper hand. \"They're dependent, so that puts them in a weak position,\" Lewis said. Huawei has already run into problems in the deployment of its 5G technology amid concerns that its devices pose national security risks. New Zealand and Australia have barred Huawei equipment from its 5G mobile networks. UK telecoms group BT said earlier this week that it wouldn't buy Huawei equipment for the core of its 5G wireless network. But formally penalizing Huawei could have serious consequences for how the US-China tech fight plays out down the line. \"They'll accelerate their efforts to become independent, and they'll look for ways they can ding us,\" Lewis said, noting that China could reduce orders of Boeing airplanes, or target US companies for violations of Chinese law. \"Their hope is that in 10 years, they won't need us anymore.\"\n",
      "Nancy Pelosi moves closer to the speaker's gavel, the outlook dims for a major criminal justice reform bill, President Trump wants another North Korea summit, and the GOP grows more fearful of what Robert Mueller knows. It's all on Inside Politics.\n"
